    Command line values specify the command line arguments given to
    tool spawns. Depending on the context this may represent either
    only tool arguments or the full command specification with the
    tool to spawn as the first argument.

(** {1:tool Tools}

    Tools are the first argument of commands. *)

type tool = B0__fpath.t
(** The type for command line tools.

    A command line tool is represented by a file path according to
    the POSIX convention for [exec(3)]. If it is made of a single
    segment, for example [Fpath.v "ocaml"], it represents a program
    name to be looked up via a search procedure; for example in the
    [PATH] environment variable. If it is a file path with multiple
    segments (POSIX would say if they contain a slash characters)
    the program is the file itself.

    {b Note.} For portability one should not use the [.exe] suffix on
    Windows on tools. This should be handled transparently by
    {!type-tool_search} procedures. *)

(** [tool t] is [arg t], used for reading clarity. *)

(** The type for tool search functions.

    These are functions that resolve and {{!set_tool}set} the
    {!get_tool} argument of commands to a concrete program executable.
    Or return an error message if the tool cannot be resolved.
    See {!B0_std.Os.Cmd.section-tool_search}

(** {1:stamps Stamps}

    Stamps are not useful unless you are interested in memoizing
    tool invocation.

    This module allows to {!Cmd.unstamp} command arguments.

    Unstamped arguments have no special semantics as far as the
    command line is concerned they simply indicate that the argument
    value itself does not influence the outputs of the tool.
    Unstamped arguments do not appear in the command line
    {{!Cmd.to_list_and_stamp}stamp} which can be used as a key to
    memoize tool spawns.

    A typical example of unstamped arguments are file paths to
    inputs: it's often the file contents not the actual file path that
    determines the tool output; beware though that some tool use both
    the file path contents and the actual file path in their
    outputs. See {{!examples}examples}. *)

val unstamp : t -> t
(** [unstamp cmd] indicates that arguments [cmd] do not influence the
    tool's invocation outputs. These arguments are omitted from
    the command line's {{!to_list_and_stamp}stamp}, see {!section-stamps}
    for more details and {{!examples}examples}. *)

val to_stamp : t -> string list
(** [to_stamp l] is the sequence of stamped arguments. *)

val to_list_and_stamp : t -> string list * string list
(** [to_list_and_stamp l] is a [l] as a list of strings tuppled with
    its stamp: the sequence of stamped arguments. *)
