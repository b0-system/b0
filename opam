WARNING this package is unstable and work in progress, do not depend on it. 

B0 describes software construction and deployments using modular and
customizable definitions written in OCaml.

At the core of B0 is the `b0.memo` library which provides arbitrary 
build abstraction with reliable, efficient incremental rebuilds.

B0 is distributed under the ISC license. It depends on [cmdliner][cmdliner].
