  type pos = int
  (** The type for zero-based, absolute, byte positions in text. *)

  type line = int

  type line_pos = line * pos
  (** The type for line positions. The line number and the byte
      position of the first element on the line. The later is the
      byte position after the newline which may not exist (at the end
      of file). *)

  type t
  (** The type for text locations. A text location is a range of byte
      positions and the lines on which they occur in the UTF-8 encoded
      text of a particular file. *)

    file:fpath -> sbyte:pos -> ebyte:pos -> sline:line_pos -> eline:line_pos ->
    t
  (** [v ~file ~sbyte ~ebyte ~sline ~eline] is a contructor for
      text locations. See corresponding accessors for the semantics.
      If you don't have a file use {!no_file}. *)

  val file : t -> fpath
  (** [file l] is [l]'s file. *)

  val sbyte : t -> pos

  val merge : t -> t -> t
  (** [merge l0 l1] merges the location [l0] and [l1] to the smallest
      location that spans both location. The file path taken from [l0]. *)

  val to_start : t -> t
  (** [to_start l] has both start and end positions at [l]'s start. *)

  (** [pp_gnu] formats location according to the
      {{:https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/standards.html#Errors}GNU

  (** [string with_index_range ~first ~last s] are the consecutive bytes of [s]
      whose indices exist in the range \[[first];[last]\].

      [first] defaults to [0] and last to [String.length s - 1].

      Note that both [first] and [last] can be any integer. If
      [first > last] the interval is empty and the empty string is
      returned. *)

  val string_replace : start:int -> stop:int -> rep:string -> string -> string
  (** [string_replace ~start ~stop ~rep s] replaces the index range
      \[[start];stop-1\] of [s] with [rep] as follows. If [start = stop]
      the [rep] is inserted before [start]. [start] and [stop] must be
      in range \[[0];[String.length s]\] and [start <= stop] or
      [Invalid_argument] is raised. *)
end

(** Text decoder.

    A text decoder inputs UTF-8 data and checks its validity.  It
    updates locations according to advances in the input and has a
    token buffer used for lexing. *)

  (** [loc_to_here d ~sbyte ~sline] is a location that starts at
      [~sbyte] and [~sline] and ends at the current decoding
      position. *)

  (** [loc_here d] is like {!loc_to_here} with the start position
      at the current decoding position. *)

  exception Err of Tloc.t * string
  (** The exception for errors. A location and an error message *)

      whose {{!edit_distance}edit distance} is the smallest to [s] and
      at most at a distance of [dist] of [s] (defaults to [2]). If

    ?post:(Format.formatter -> unit -> unit) ->
    kind:string -> (Format.formatter -> 'a -> unit) ->
    Format.formatter -> 'a * 'a list -> unit
  (** [did_you_mean ~pre kind ~post pp_v] formats a faulty value [v] of
      kind [kind] and a list of [hints] that [v] could have been
      mistaken for.

      [pre] defaults to [unit "Unknown"], [post] to {!nop} they surround
      the faulty value before the "did you mean" part as follows ["%a %s
      %a%a." pre () kind pp_v v post ()]. If [hints] is empty no "did
      you mean" part is printed. *)

      the current position and moves to the byte after it. Raises
      {!Err} in case of UTF-8 decoding error. *)

  val accept_byte : t -> unit
  (** [accept_byte d] accepts the byte at the current position and
      moves to the next byte. {b Warning.} Faster than {!accept_uchar}
      but the client needs to make sure it's not accepting invalid
      UTF-8 data, i.e. that [byte d] is an US-ASCII encoded character
      (i.e. [<= 0x7F]). *)

  (** {1:tok Token buffer} *)

  val tok_accept_byte : t -> unit
  (** [tok_accept_byte d] is like {!accept_byte} but also
      adds the byte to the token. {b Warning.} {!accept_byte}'s
